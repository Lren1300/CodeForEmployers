Hello!

These are some of my projects that I have programed while being a student at Grand Valley State University!
They are split by language, and the most recent project will be in all CAPS.
The project files will be located in the src folder in each project as these were taken right from Github or the IDE.

Thank you for viewing my work and for your time and consideration!
