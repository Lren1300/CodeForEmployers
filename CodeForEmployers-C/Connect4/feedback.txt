Nice work on a tough project.

See notes in the .c files.

One thing to fix:  Don't duplicate your if/else blocks in main game loop.
(Fixing it now will save you time in later projects)

==============
Impressively thorough tests. (m)

Do all of your horizontal and vertical tests begin from the same place?
(Is the winning streak always anchored to the bottom or left?)
If so, a little variation would make the tests even stronger.

Do you have any tests that give invalid input (e.g., try to overfill a column?)
