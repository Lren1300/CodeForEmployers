a. The fail was due to a previous version of our test code being submitted on accident. 
   We have had some git problems between the two of us but have since figured it out.

b. We updated the test code so it was to the current, working version without the bugged tests

c. In the future, instead of just fixing the code files mistakes from the git miss-hap, we should check all files, including the tests.
